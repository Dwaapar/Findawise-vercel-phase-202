# Export/Import Booster + Master Deployment Script
## Empire-Grade Multi-Region Disaster-Ready System

üéØ **Billion-Dollar Grade Export/Import and Deployment Infrastructure**

This comprehensive system provides enterprise-grade export/import capabilities and master deployment orchestration for the entire Findawise Empire stack, enabling full backup, cloning, migration, and rapid deployment across multiple environments with disaster recovery capabilities.

   - Pre/post deployment hooks with rollback automation
   - Real-time monitoring and audit trails

3. **Empire Deploy CLI** (`empire-deploy-cli.js`)
   - Production-ready command-line interface
   - Interactive deployment configuration
   - Real-time monitoring and logging
   - Export/import management capabilities

4. **Admin Dashboard** (`/admin/deployment-dashboard`)

## üö® Disaster Recovery

### Automated Backup Schedule
```bash
# Daily full backups (production)
0 2 * * * /path/to/empire-deploy-cli.js backup --type full --environment prod

# Weekly config backups (all environments)
0 0 * * 0 /path/to/empire-deploy-cli.js export --type config --all-environments

# Monthly archive cleanup
0 0 1 * * /path/to/empire-deploy-cli.js cleanup --older-than 90d
```

### Disaster Recovery Procedures

1. **Full System Restoration**
```bash
# Step 1: Restore from backup
./empire-deploy-cli.js restore --backup-id <latest-backup> --environment dr

# Step 2: Validate system health
./empire-deploy-cli.js health-check --environment dr --comprehensive

# Step 3: Switch traffic (manual DNS/load balancer update)
```

2. **Selective Neuron Recovery**
```bash
# Restore specific neurons from export
./empire-deploy-cli.js import --archive-id <neuron-backup> --neurons finance,health
```

3. **Cross-Region Migration**
```bash
# Export from source region
./empire-deploy-cli.js export --type full --include-analytics

# Import to target region
./empire-deploy-cli.js import --archive-id <export-id> --environment prod-west
```

## üìö Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Export Fails with Permissions Error**

   - Verify database access for data export

2. **Import Hangs During Processing**
   - Check for large file uploads exceeding limits
   - Verify archive integrity with checksum validation

3. **Deployment Fails Health Checks**
   - Review deployment logs for specific errors
   - Check service dependencies and database connections

4. **CLI Authentication Errors**
   - Verify API key is correct and has proper permissions
   - Check API base URL configuration

### Support
- Check deployment logs in `/admin/deployment-dashboard`
- Use CLI status commands for real-time information
- Review audit trail for operation history
- Contact DevOps team for escalation
