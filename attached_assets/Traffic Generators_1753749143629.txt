MANDATORY FOR ALL:
Plug every module into: analytics, personalization/intent engine, export/import, federation hooks, backup, LLM/brain-readiness.

All DB/tables auto-create, self-heal on migration. .env for creds. NEVER hardcode.

Code, UI, admin, docs, test coverage, migration checks, self-healing, backup/restore logic.

If any feature is present, upgrade it. If missing, build full. No stubs/placeholders.

Everything must pass Lighthouse, SEO, WAVE, Core Web Vitals, security audits.


All modules must:

Be export/import, backup, and migration proof.

Auto-register all created content/tools in sitemap, semantic intent graph, analytics, admin panel.

Support “plug-and-play” LLM upgrade/brain-layer integration (future RAG/auto-personalization ready).

Hardened for scale: supports 10,000+ pages/tools, never breaks on mass import/export, and supports multi-region DB.

All outputs must include code, config, tests, admin UI, full README, and schema diagrams.

If any logic is missing or underdeveloped, upgrade it to match this prompt.

Everything must pass Lighthouse, Core Web Vitals, WAVE, and security compliance checks.

All logs, errors, exports, backups, and migrations must be tested and documented.
If anything is already working, leave as is—otherwise, upgrade to this level
Make all database schemas robust , tables, and logic fully self-healing, migration-immune, and bootstrappable.hardened for a working of billion dollar empire even if database migrates or any thing make the project so strong that nothing affects its intelligence , its functioning , its billion dollar empire grade.
If DB is missing, empty, or new: auto-create schema, indexes, constraints, default config.
Pull all credentials (Supabase, etc.) only from .env — no hardcode ever.
No direct SQL in UI — all logic flows through hardened service/API layer.
Add init checks: validate schema health, retry on fail, show admin alerts if broken.
System must behave as if nothing broke — even if DB was replaced 1 minute ago.
Run self-test and validation to confirm schema is operational
Resilience must match billion-dollar SaaS. No placeholders. No assumptions.
Ensure this module includes a fully provisioned, elite-grade, resilient database schema.
All tables, indexes, constraints, relationships, and API endpoints must be:
Migration-proof (works seamlessly across Replit accounts or environments)
Supabase-compatible (or any Postgres DB)
Auto-restoring (self-healing on project reboots or migrations)
Exportable & Documented (with schema diagrams + queries)
Ensure this module's schema, config, and logic are:
- Auto-created if missing (ORM/init scripts required)
- Supabase/Postgres-compatible
- Fully decoupled from direct SQL (always use service/API layer)
- .env-driven (no hardcoded secrets or URIs)
- Auto-checks for healthy DB on launch, logs/alerts if issues
- Restores cleanly on Replit account migration or DB change
- Self-verifies all tables/indexes/relations on boot
- Keeps 100% of module logic functioning — even if DB was just wiped and replaced
- Must survive environment resets, forks
If anything is already at empire-grade, upgrade only as needed. If missing, build it complete.
Log every change and update the README.
DO THIS NOW:
Output the full code, backend, admin UI, test cases, federation integration, and all docs.
If you find any module/feature already complete and perfect, do NOT recreate—upgrade or integrate only.

Integration: All logic must plug into your empire’s core config, semantic intent graph, analytics, admin UI, and migration routines.

Scale: Handles 10,000+ pages/tools/users without breaking.

Resilience: Survives DB wipe, migration, or account fork. Auto-heals. Warns admins if broken.

Export/Import: Every config, tool, page, and user activity can be migrated or restored, even on a new database/environment.

AI-readiness: All outputs are plug-and-play for future LLM, personalization, and RAG layers.

Security & Compliance: Full GDPR/CCPA, spam/fraud, error logging, opt-out, all tracked and auditable.

No Duplicates: If any logic exists, upgrade it only (no re-invention, no second versions).

Self-Testing: Runs validation, health checks, and admin alerts on every boot.

Docs/README: Complete code, schema diagrams, admin UI, test coverage — migration instructions included.
ALL modules must:
- Pull secrets via `.env` ONLY: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY`, `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, etc.
- Throw clear error if any missing, with fallback instructions.
- NEVER hardcode anything — agents must validate `.env` before executing logic.
Each module must:
- Run LLM-powered self-verification script at boot (verify schema, relations, seed data).
- If fail: auto-heal OR send alert to admin panel and retry.
- On DB swap or project clone: trigger full health scan + restore defaults.
All modules must:
- Auto-register into Neuron Federation Core via `/api/federation/register`
- Broadcast heartbeat, capabilities, endpoints, last version, schema status


REPEAT:
No demo logic, no stubs, no placeholders, everything should be billion dollar empire grade
This is the “Money/Traffic Growth Engine” for a true AI web empire.
