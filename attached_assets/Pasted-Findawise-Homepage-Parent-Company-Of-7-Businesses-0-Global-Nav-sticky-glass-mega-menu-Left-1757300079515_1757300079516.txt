Mega-menu: “Companies”

7 tiles (each is a company): Automation Services, Workflow Store, Digital Assets, AI Agents, Affiliate Hub, Decision Platform, Services (Tools).

Each tile = icon → one-liner → 2 bullets → CTA. Keep simple, chunked, and keyboard-navigable (hover delay, focus management, never full-screen takeover). Mega-menus work, but simplicity + interaction details are key.

Use semantic <nav> + link lists; avoid ARIA role="menu" for basic site nav (reserve it for app-style action menus).

1) Hero (company-of-companies + motion)

Headline:

Hero video / animation (pick 1 for launch; all accessible & fast)

A) “Orbit” cinematic (8–12s, MP4/WebM): 7 luminous nodes (each BU) orbit a central “Empire OS”. Hover highlights a node; click opens BU overlay. Implement with <video muted playsinline autoplay loop>; encode & compress to keep LCP green. Provide a static poster + Pause Motion control; honor prefers-reduced-motion.

B) Lottie vector: flowing routes “inputs → OS → outputs” (tiny payload, crisp). Use intersection observers to stop when offscreen; compress JSON.

C) Rive interactive: subtle constellation reacts to pointer; programmatically pause for reduced-motion users.

Performance notes: video can be LCP—optimize codecs/containers; lazy-load where possible; test.

Want it as a high-fidelity hero + layout?

I can immediately generate a Next.js SSR homepage (hero video ready, accessible mega-menu, all sections + copy wired) or a Figma frame with the orbit-video storyboard and component specs. If you want the code, say “Ship the Next.js homepage,” and I’ll deliver it in this chat in one go.
