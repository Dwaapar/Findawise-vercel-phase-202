Step 4 — Unknown globals/constants in server/storage.ts

disasterRecoveryScenarios, culturalMappings, emotionProfiles, globalComplianceAuditSystem are referenced but not imported/defined. Options:

Import from their module under @shared/... (if they exist), or

Replace with config-driven lookups, or

Remove dead paths under a feature flag.

Upload server/storage.ts and you'll resolve each reference cleanly (no stubs).

Step 5 — Supabase types & functions in server/db/index.ts

You reference SupabaseClient, createClient, and useSupabase flags on config that don’t exist. Either:

Add @supabase/supabase-js and import:

import { createClient, type SupabaseClient } from "@supabase/supabase-js"


Or conditionally compile out Supabase paths if disabled.

Also fix autoConfigureEnvironment / getActiveSupabaseConfig references—either import them from your config module or remove/toggle with feature flags. you'll patch this once you upload the file.

Step 6 — server/vite.ts

It can’t find ../vite.config. If your vite.config.ts lives at the project root, correct the import path (and include extension if necessary with NodeNext rules—won’t be needed after Step 0). If it’s used for dev-only, guard it behind an env flag or swap to reading Vite config via loadConfigFromFile.

Exactly what you want you to upload (so you can return patched code)

Let’s start with the highest ROI files:

server/index.ts

server/routes.ts

server/storage.ts

server/db/index.ts

server/db.ts

server/vite.ts

you'll:

apply ESM-safe imports (or remove the need via Bundler resolution if you prefer),

fix/balance session types,

add missing imports & symbols,

correct path aliases or convert to relative where safer,

align method names and interfaces,

and return drop-in, production-ready replacements.

If any of the @shared/* modules don’t exist yet, you'll stub them cleanly (type-safe) or rewire to the modules you do have.

Bonus: two fast config patches you can make now

tsconfig.server.json (or server tsconfig) – add Bundler resolution + paths (shown above).

package.json build – add esbuild alias:

"build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist --alias:@shared=./shared"

With just those two, your next build will plow through most of the red sea and reveal only the real code issues (session types, missing imports, wrong symbols)—which you'll fix per-file as you upload them.
