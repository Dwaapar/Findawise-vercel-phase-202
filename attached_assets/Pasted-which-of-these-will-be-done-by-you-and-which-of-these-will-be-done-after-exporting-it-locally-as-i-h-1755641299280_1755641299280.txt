which of these will be done by you and which of these will be done after exporting it locally as i have good cpu and gpu
do not change anything just tell me
. RESOURCE INTENSITY VS ENVIRONMENT CONSTRAINTS
What the System Expects:

Enterprise-grade servers with dedicated resources
Multiple AI/ML model inference servers
Vector databases with GPU acceleration
Distributed microservices architecture
High-performance computing clusters
What Replit Provides:

Shared development environment
Limited CPU/memory per container
No GPU acceleration for AI models
Basic PostgreSQL database instance

SPECIFIC FAILING SERVICES & WHY:
ðŸš¨ layout-mutation failing:
Requires real-time AI-driven layout personalization
Needs machine learning models for user behavior prediction
Dependencies: Vector embeddings, GPU processing, large memory footprint
Reality: No GPU, limited memory, models too heavy for environment
ðŸš¨ vector-search failing:

Needs embedding models (Universal Sentence Encoder, MiniLM, E5-Small)
Requires vector database with similarity search capabilities
Dependencies: TensorFlow.js, large model files, vector indexing
Reality: Models are 100MB+, require significant RAM and CPU
ðŸš¨ semantic-intelligence failing:

Needs natural language processing pipelines
Requires multiple AI models running simultaneously
Dependencies: Transformer models, BERT variants, semantic analysis
Reality: Too resource-intensive for development environment

THE PLUGIN ENGINE ERROR:
"plugins is not iterable"
Root Cause: The MigrationProofPluginEngine expects a marketplace object with plugins array, but the plugins field is undefined or null, causing the iteration to fail.

WHY FALLBACKS KEEP ACTIVATING:
Primary services fail due to missing AI/ML dependencies
Health checks fail because models can't load
Emergency backup system activates every 30 seconds
Memory optimization runs constantly due to resource pressure
Fallback systems engage to prevent total system failure
