Automation Services — “We do it for you”

What it is: End-to-end, done-for-you process automation across ops, growth, support, finance, and data. We map your workflows, integrate your stack, and ship reliable automations with SLAs, monitoring, and runbooks.

Who it’s for: Teams that want outcomes, not tooling — founders, COOs, RevOps, Support/Success, Finance Ops.

What’s included

Process mining & SOP design (swimlanes, failure paths, guardrails)

System integration (CRM/ERP, billing, data warehouse, email, Slack)

Automations (triggers, queues, retries, idempotency, alerts)

Observability (dashboards, logs, on-call, error budgets)

Security (least-privilege keys, secret rotation, data retention)

Delivery model

72-Hour Pilot: 1 high-value workflow automated, metrics wired (time saved, errors avoided).

Scale-up: 5–20 workflows, dashboards, on-call, playbooks.

Run & Improve: Monthly reliability + ROI reviews, backlog burn-down.

Typical stack: Python/Node, Airflow/Temporal, n8n/Make/Zapier (when appropriate), Postgres/BigQuery, Kafka/SQS, Slack/Teams, HubSpot/Salesforce, Stripe/QuickBooks, REST/GraphQL.

KPIs: Tasks automated/month, minutes saved/task, SLA success %, error rate, $ ROI.

Pricing: Fixed-fee pilot → monthly retainer (tiered by # workflows/SLA). Infra billed at cost.

Examples

Lead intake → enrichment → routing → meeting booked

Invoice ingestion → 3-way match → reconciliation → dispute escalation

Support triage → classify → auto-reply → human-handoff with context

What we need from you (day 0): Tool access, sample data, “happy path + failure path,” success KPI.

Workflow Store — Prebuilt Flows

What it is: A catalog of plug-and-play workflows (scrape, enrich, outreach, finance ops, QA, reporting) you can deploy in minutes and customize as needed.

What’s included

One-click deployment (Docker/Compose templates, env templates)

Config UI (secrets, schedules, webhooks), schema + mapping

Observability out of the box (logs, metrics, alert hooks)

Versioned updates & patch notes

Commercial license with modification rights

Pricing: Per-workflow license or bundles; enterprise site-license available.

Categories: Leadgen, Data Quality, Finance Ops, Support, RevOps, Compliance, Content Ops.

KPIs: Time to first run (TTFR), runs/day, error rate, conversion lift (for GTM flows).

Example flows

“Scrape → Deduplicate → Enrich (Clearbit/PeopleDataLabs) → Sequence (Apollo/HubSpot)”

“Refund detection → Ledger entry → Slack approvals → CRM note”

“Daily KPI rollups → anomaly alerts → exec digest”

What we need from you: Destination systems, field mappings, schedule, constraints.

Digital Assets

What it is: Ready-to-use assets that accelerate execution: prompt packs, datasets, playbooks, UI kits, and creative bundles aligned to growth and automation.

What’s inside

Prompt Packs: Tested agent prompts (intake, qualification, objection handling, summarization).

Datasets: Cleaned seed datasets for training/eval (intents, FAQs, PII-scrubbed examples).

Playbooks: SOPs, email/cadence templates, QA rubrics, escalation trees.

UI Kits: Figma/Tailwind component libraries for ops dashboards and admin tools.

Creative Bundles: Ad variations, landing page sections, offer angles for affiliates.

Licensing: Commercial use, royalty-free. Optional exclusivity for custom packs.

Use cases: Spin up agents faster, standardize QA, ship internal tools without design debt.

KPIs: Time to deploy, CSAT, reply quality scores, CTR/CVR (for creative assets).

AI Agents — Managed & Self-Host

What it is: Production agents that do work (not just chat) — with tool use, retrieval, memory, approvals, and strict cost controls. Offered as managed service or self-hosted.

Capabilities

Tool-using action graphs (APIs, DB, scrapers, RPA)

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with citations

Conversation memory & state machines

Guardrails: policies, sandboxing, rate/cost caps, human-in-the-loop

Audit logs, transcripts, replay & red-teaming

Deployment options

Managed: We host, monitor, and iterate (fastest time-to-value)

Self-host: Your VPC/Kubernetes; we deliver infra code + runbooks

Typical agents

SDR agent: qualify, route, book meetings; sync to CRM

Support agent: diagnose, resolve, escalate with context

Ops agent: reconcile, enrich, file tickets, notify stakeholders

KPIs: First-contact resolution, bookings/100 convos, avg handle time, cost/convo, deflection rate.

Pricing: Per-agent + usage; enterprise flat-rate available. Pilots capped with success criteria.

What we need from you: Tooling/API access, policy boundaries, success metrics, sandbox data.
