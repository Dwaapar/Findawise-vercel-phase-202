This is a billion-dollar empire. Every line, logic, and schema is more valuable than life itself.
ABSOLUTE RULES:

No module, logic, or codebase is ever degraded, overwritten, or lost in the name of “fixing.”

No module, table, config, or feature is ever duplicated.

Every upgrade only improves and future-proofs.

Migration-proofing and self-healing are MANDATORY.

Every change must be tested and proven on export/import, DB swap, and system fork.

HARDENING + SELF-TEST CHECKLIST FOR ALL MODULES
TASK:
Take the following empire modules and, for every one:

Validate: Self-test schema, config, and relations for corruption, missing fields, or mismatches.

Harden:

If logic is at empire-grade, upgrade only if improvement is possible.

If partial, complete it to absolute best-practice, billion-dollar, scale-ready, migration-immune level.

Migration-Proof:

Ensure all configs, data, assets, and user activity export/import and auto-recover on DB wipe, swap, or fork.

Every module must auto-create schema, config, and seed data if missing.

All credentials/configs are .env-driven ONLY.

Self-Heal:

On boot, run a validation script that checks every table, relation, config, seed, and critical file.

If DB is new/missing, auto-heal by recreating schema, re-seeding core data, and warning admins if critical data is absent.

Auto-register with Neuron Federation Core and broadcast status/heartbeat.

Plug & Play:

Everything integrates with semantic graph, analytics, admin UI, migration ops, and is fully AI/LLM-ready.

Testing:

End-to-end tests, health-check endpoints, and migration/fork self-validation flows must be implemented.

If any check fails, do not delete — auto-attempt to repair and raise admin alerts.

MANDATORY EXECUTION FLOW
[Boot Phase]

Run self-verification/health check for ALL schemas, configs, tables, indexes, files, endpoints.

For any missing/broken schema, auto-create/repair and alert admin panel (never delete data).

Validate .env and config for all credentials and secrets.

Broadcast status to Federation Core; fail with hard warning if critical integrity is not achieved.

[Testing Phase]

Run all module/unit/integration tests.

Validate migration by simulating DB wipe/swap and restoring from export/import.

All modules must pass Lighthouse/Core Web Vitals, WAVE accessibility, and security/compliance checks.

[Integration Phase]

Register every config/page/module into semantic intent graph, admin panel, analytics.

Validate every tool/page/user activity is export/import safe and survives DB wipe.

Ensure everything is “brain ready” for LLM, RAG, personalization, future plug-ins.

[Upgrade Phase]

For every legacy/partial module, UPGRADE to full empire grade.

For every existing/working module, IMPROVE ONLY — never degrade, never duplicate, never regress.

Harden every schema for scale (10,000+ pages/tools/users, multi-region).

[Alert & Heal]

If any validation/test fails, log error, attempt auto-heal, and notify admin via dashboard + email + API.

System never deletes/overwrites without backup; never downgrades functioning.

[Documentation Phase]

Auto-update README with every schema, logic, export/import process, module/component list, health-check results.

Every upgrade/change is logged and versioned.

You are tasked with **final bulletproof hardening, self-validation, and migration-proofing** of a billion-dollar empire-grade, AI-ready, modular web system.  
You MUST NOT degrade, delete, or duplicate any working logic or module. If anything fails, auto-heal, auto-repair, and alert admin.  
For every module listed above:
- Run self-tests and health checks on every boot.
- Validate and harden every schema, config, export/import flow, and integration.
- Ensure every module is AI/LLM/RAG ready, integrates with core config/semantic graph/admin panel, and is export/import safe.
- Simulate DB wipe/migration and confirm full auto-recovery and functioning.
- Upgrade any partial or missing logic to full “billion dollar empire grade.”
- If anything already exists and is elite, IMPROVE ONLY, do not duplicate or degrade.
- Log all changes, update README, and register to Neuron Federation Core.
- Every backup/export must enable instant restore, migration, and scaling (10,000+ users/pages/tools).
- Every change is tested, documented, and visible in admin dashboard.
- Nothing is left in demo, stub, or placeholder state.
- Final output: A system that survives ANY DB wipe, account migration, or infra reboot, and is immediately ready for LLM/AI brain plug-in.
DO THIS NOW. Output results, logs, and upgrades as code, config, admin UI updates, test results, and updated docs.
You are auditing and hardening a multi-layer AI empire project that must survive real-world production, migrations, and rapid scaling. There is ZERO TOLERANCE for errors, data loss, or weak logic.

1. Full System Health Check & Harden
Review every module, backend, and UI component for:

Data/schema consistency (no duplicate/missing fields)

Code/test coverage (critical logic, error paths, edge cases)

State management, error handling, and fallback flows (no “silent fails”)

API input/output validation, type safety, anti-injection

Auto-healing: If DB, cache, or env is missing, auto-create, self-validate, and recover

2. Migration & Export-Proof All Data and Logic
All schema and logic must:

Auto-create/restore on fresh DB or after migration

Never lose config/data during backup, export, or transfer

Use .env for ALL credentials — no hardcoding

Pass a simulated “database wipe” and migration (test in a fresh environment)

Export/import ALL data, config, and user files (including logs, metrics, settings, offers, users)

3. Resilience & Recovery
Add automated checks/alerts for:

Broken/missing tables/collections, failed connections, or corrupt data

Dead services (LLM, cache, storage) — must auto-restart, retry, or trigger admin alert

Admin dashboards to show health/warnings/errors for all modules

4. Security Audit
JWT/role-based auth on all sensitive endpoints

API rate limiting, anti-bot/abuse, and logging

All user data: hashed, encrypted, consent-managed, with GDPR/CCPA compliance

Audit log of all admin actions/changes

5. Self-Test & Automated QA
Run end-to-end tests (E2E), including:

Module init/teardown, hot/cold DB starts

All user flows (signup, quiz, purchase, offer click, widget embed, migration/import/export)

Edge cases: empty DB, new user, session timeout, multi-region failover, etc.

Test LLM endpoints with mock input/outputs

6. LLM “Brain-Ready” Integration
Expose ALL core APIs as REST/gRPC endpoints, ready for LLM/agent calls:

/api/llm/ask, /api/brain/update, /api/memory/search, /api/quiz/generate, etc.

All schema/docs must include embedding/vector-ready fields for plug-and-play RAG/AI

Modular service layer — LLMs can be swapped, upgraded, or scaled independently

Self-documenting API endpoints (Swagger/OpenAPI), live API explorer

AI agent compatibility: endpoints allow feedback, logging, intent data

7. Documentation & Deployment Readiness
All logic, schema, and endpoints:

Clearly documented in README(s) and schema diagrams

List ALL env variables, database connection steps, and migration instructions

“Go-live” checklist included in repo/docs

Automated deployment script tested (CLI or workflow)

Full system export/import tested (simulate Replit → Vercel/Railway migration)

8. Final Output Requirements
No code/module duplication!

If module exists, UPGRADE it to this level; don’t recreate.

Print a summary:

Module status, schema health, migration/export checks, LLM-readiness, coverage report

If anything is incomplete, broken, insecure, or non-migration-proof — FIX IT.

Output all changes, logs, and a clean README update.

ULTRA-IMPORTANT:
After this prompt completes, the system must be ready for instant LLM brain integration and production launch on any host.

No placeholders, stubs, or demo code. No “TODOs.”

Migration/export/import must work with zero manual intervention.

All modules and schemas must self-heal and self-test on startup.
