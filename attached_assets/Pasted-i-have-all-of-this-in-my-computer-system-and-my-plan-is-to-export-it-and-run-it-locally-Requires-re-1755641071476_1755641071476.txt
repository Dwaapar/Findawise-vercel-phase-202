i have all of this in my computer system and my plan is to export it and run it locally
Requires real-time AI-driven layout personalization
Needs machine learning models for user behavior prediction
Dependencies: Vector embeddings, GPU processing, large memory footprint
Reality: No GPU, limited memory, models too heavy for environment

i have proper gpu and cpu for this in my computer make all the things and tell me how to do
Needs embedding models (Universal Sentence Encoder, MiniLM, E5-Small)
Requires vector database with similarity search capabilities
Dependencies: TensorFlow.js, large model files, vector indexing
Reality: Models are 100MB+, require significant RAM and CPU

make these and i have local ai models like mixtral llama 3.1 deepseek coder but i do not know how to use them in this
Needs natural language processing pipelines
Requires multiple AI models running simultaneously
Dependencies: Transformer models, BERT variants, semantic analysis

i want to integrate ai/ml in it and i have the local llm's too but i do vnot know how

tell me whatever you can do so that i can export it and run locally this f1 race car
