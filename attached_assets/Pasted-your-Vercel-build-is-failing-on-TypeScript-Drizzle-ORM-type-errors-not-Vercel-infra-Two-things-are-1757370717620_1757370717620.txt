your Vercel build is failing on TypeScript/Drizzle ORM type errors, not Vercel infra. Two things are wrong:

Your DB schema types and server/storage.ts are out of sync. You’re calling Drizzle inserts/updates with the wrong shape (often {}) or with fields that don’t exist. Example errors: passing {} where position or activityType are required; trying to set updatedAt on objects that don’t define it; referencing a column that isn’t in the table (timestamp vs date/updatedAt). 
You have missing symbols/imports. Code references things that aren’t defined anywhere: translations, translationKeys, culturalMappings, regions, etc. That alone spawns hundreds of errors. 



That’s why you see 6,200+ errors: the same root issues repeat across many lines/files. (The log even says you’re only seeing the last 10k lines.) 



What the errors mean (with fixes)
A) Wrong payloads for Drizzle .insert() / .values() / .update().set()

Symptoms

“No overload matches this call… Argument of type {} is not assignable… position/activityType/sessionId is missing.”
You’re passing empty objects or incomplete objects where required fields are typed as required. Examples: lead_form_assignments.position, lead_activities.activityType, lead_captures.sessionId/email. 



 



“Object literal may only specify known properties… updatedAt/isProcessed/status does not exist…”
You’re trying to set columns that aren’t in the table type you’re updating, or you used the wrong type for the update source. 



 



“Property timestamp does not exist on type neuron_analytics.”
Your code expects a timestamp column, but the table type only has date/updatedAt (per the error). Rename usage or add the column. 



How to fix (do these concretely)

Use the right types when building values/updates.
For each table:

import { InferInsertModel, InferSelectModel } from 'drizzle-orm';
type NewLeadActivity = InferInsertModel<typeof leadActivities>;
const value: NewLeadActivity = { activityType: 'opened', /* ...required fields... */ };
await db.insert(leadActivities).values(value);


Never pass {}. If some fields are optional, mark them optional in the schema or give defaults.

Only set columns that actually exist on the table.
If you want updatedAt auto-managed, define it in schema with an on-update hook/default (or set it via SQL):

// schema
updatedAt: timestamp('updated_at', { mode: 'date' }).defaultNow().notNull(),
// on update
await db.update(table).set({ updatedAt: new Date() });


If the schema doesn’t have updatedAt, remove those sets—or add the column (and run the migration). 



Fix column mismatches.
Replace code that uses non-existent columns (timestamp, status, etc.) with the real columns (date, updatedAt, stats?.status, etc.). 



B) Missing imports / undefined constants

Symptoms

“Cannot find name ‘translations’ / ‘translationKeys’ / ‘culturalMappings’ / ‘regions’…”
These identifiers aren’t imported/declared. 



How to fix

Import them from the module where they live. If you removed those modules, delete or guard the code using them (e.g., behind feature flags). As a stopgap, you can define safe empty fallbacks:

const translations: Record<string, any> = {};
const translationKeys: string[] = [];

Fastest route to green (execution plan)

Pin & align versions (drizzle-orm/drizzle-kit/pg/typescript) across phase-192 and phase-193. Mismatched versions change the generated types and overloads.

npm ls drizzle-orm drizzle-kit typescript pg


Regenerate types (if you use Drizzle codegen) so your schema and TS types agree.

Targeted refactors (high-impact hot spots) in server/storage.ts:

Fix all .values({}) / .values([{ }]) calls to pass a typed object with the actual required fields (position, activityType, sessionId, email, etc.). 



 



Remove or add columns so you stop setting non-existent fields (updatedAt, isProcessed, status, timestamp). 



 



Add the missing imports (translations, translationKeys, etc.) or delete those blocks. 



Sanity queries (to find the offenders quickly):

Empty payloads:

PowerShell:
Select-String -Path server\storage.ts -Pattern '\.values\(\s*\{\s*\}\s*\)'

Wrong column names:
Select-String -Path server\storage.ts -Pattern '\btimestamp\b|\bstatus\b|\bisProcessed\b|\bupdatedAt\b'

Missing symbols:
Select-String -Path server\storage.ts -Pattern '\btranslations\b|\btranslationKeys\b|\bculturalMappings\b|\bregions\b'

(If you must ship before fixing types): You can bypass TS checks in Next.js:

// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  typescript: { ignoreBuildErrors: true },
  eslint: { ignoreDuringBuilds: true },
};


This deploys but does not fix runtime bugs. Use only as a temporary release valve.

Why this happened

A refactor/upgrades changed table types and required fields, but server/storage.ts wasn’t updated to match.

Large files centralized a lot of logic, so one mismatch created a cascade of overload/type errors everywhere.

Missing imports increased the error count dramatically because every reference line fails
