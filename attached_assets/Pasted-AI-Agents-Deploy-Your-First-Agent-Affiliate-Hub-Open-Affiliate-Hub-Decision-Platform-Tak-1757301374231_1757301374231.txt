Boss-Level Design Notes (so incumbents sweat)

House-of-brands clarity (Companies first), not “features”: users find the right business fast. (Hick’s law: reduce/organize choices.)

Scannable copy everywhere: one-liners + bullets + action verbs; proven to increase usability.

Want it as a high-fidelity hero + layout?

I can immediately generate a Next.js SSR homepage (hero video ready, accessible mega-menu, all sections + copy wired) or a Figma frame with the orbit-video storyboard and component specs. If you want the code, say “Ship the Next.js homepage,” and I’ll deliver it in this chat in one go.
