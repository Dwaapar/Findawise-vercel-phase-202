Mega-menu: “Companies”

7 tiles (each is a company): Automation Services, Workflow Store, Digital Assets, AI Agents, Affiliate Hub, Decision Platform, Services (Tools).

Each tile = icon → one-liner → 2 bullets → CTA. Keep simple, chunked, and keyboard-navigable (hover delay, focus management, never full-screen takeover). Mega-menus work, but simplicity + interaction details are key.

Hero video / animation (pick 1 for launch; all accessible & fast)

A) “Orbit” cinematic (8–12s, MP4/WebM): 7 luminous nodes (each BU) orbit a central “Empire OS”. Hover highlights a node; click opens BU overlay. Implement with <video muted playsinline autoplay loop>; encode & compress to keep LCP green. Provide a static poster + Pause Motion control; honor prefers-reduced-motion.

B) Lottie vector: flowing routes “inputs → OS → outputs” (tiny payload, crisp). Use intersection observers to stop when offscreen; compress JSON.

C) Rive interactive: subtle constellation reacts to pointer; programmatically pause for reduced-motion users.

Performance notes: video can be LCP—optimize codecs/containers; lazy-load where possible; test.

Accessibility notes: don’t obscure focus with sticky headers; ensure motion can be reduced/paused.
