You are not just generating a UI. You are creating the legendary face of an AI-powered, billion-dollar self-evolving web empire called Findawise.

The entire system is built as interconnected neurons (modules) that evolve over time using AI + real-time feedback loops. Each neuron is a self-scaling, logic-powered micro-app. This UI is the unified frontend layer that connects them all — like the skin over a living neural network.

Design Rules (non-negotiable):

Mobile-first, edge-optimized, ultra-fast

Sleek futuristic layout (SpaceX × Apple × OpenAI aesthetic)

Animations powered by Framer Motion

Modular design: All sections must be reusable blocks (tailwind-based component library or atomic structure)

Use glassmorphism, subtle gradients, neon edges, and animated SVGs

Dark mode as default; light mode toggle optional

Layouts should feel alive — hover, scroll, click interactions must evoke movement, curiosity, and energy

Incorporate emotion logic UI variations (e.g., if fear detected → red alert theme; if trust detected → soft blue secure state)

Sections to Build:

🧠 Hero Section:

Bold claim: “The World’s First Self-Evolving Affiliate Web Empire”

AI-generated slogan based on trending emotion (inject emotion map support)

Animated AI visual (SVG neural net pulsing or brain circuit evolving)

CTA: “Enter the System” / “See How It Thinks”

⚙️ Neuron Showcase Grid:

Interactive card grid — each neuron shows: name, icon, status (active/inactive), last trained

On hover: expand logic summary and link to subpage

Filter: Content / Quiz / AI / Analytics / Traffic / Security

📊 Live System Pulse Section:

Live metrics with glowing data pulses: # pages, # offers running, current AI suggestions

Includes scroll-triggered Lottie animations or live-generated data bursts

🤖 AI Brain Log:

Feed of recent AI-driven decisions or changes made by the system

e.g. “Emotion Shift: Updated CTA for solar page”, “Discovered trending niche: AI Safety in Travel”

🧬 Emotion-Driven CTA Strip:

Section adapts CTA message based on detected scroll behavior + location

CTA Examples: “Protect Your Rental Now” / “Get AI-Picked Solar Kits”

📚 Dynamic Blog Carousel:

Auto-pulls blog content previews

Emotion tags + category filters

Scroll momentum effect

💼 Trust + Authority Zone:

Logos of verified partners or AI certs

Testimonials from users

Security badges (custom-designed)

🧠 AI Quiz Generator Preview:

Allow demo of 1 question from quiz engine

CTA: “Let AI Find the Right Solution for You”

📦 Export + Dev Tool Panel:

CLI-based UI for developers to fork/export the brain

Show tech stack, GitHub stats, roadmap, commit feed

🧠 Footer:

Neural sitemap layout (like a synapse tree)
